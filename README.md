# Move.it

This project was done during RocketSeat's NextLevelWeek 4. Its goal is to encourage people who work at the computer all day to stretch using the pomodoro technique and gamification concepts.

In this project Next.js was used, taking advantage of the concepts of SSR (Server Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Side Generation), provided by Next and React.

## Install

For instalation, use the command:
> next build

It is also possible to use the **yarn build**, because it already uses the **next build**.

## Run

Running this application is simple, using the **yarn dev** command at the root of the project.

You will see that it is running at localhost:3000.
