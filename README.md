This project was done during RocketSeat's NextLevelWeek 4. Its goal is to encourage people who work at the computer all day to stretch using the pomodoro technique and gamification concepts.

In this project Next.js was used, taking advantage of the concepts of SSR (Server Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Side Generation), provided by Next and React.
